## Git Workflow

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mdazamdevops/git-version-control.git
cd <repo-name>

# 2. Create branches
git checkout -b dev        # Development branch
git checkout -b feature/ui # Feature branch
git checkout -b main       # Main branch (production-ready)

# 3. Make changes
nano <file-name>           # Edit your file
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# 4. Push changes
git push origin <branch-name>

# 5. Pull Request
#   - Open PR from feature -> dev
#   - Review & approve changes
#   - Merge into dev, then main

---

## Branching Strategy
- **main** â†’ Production-ready code
- **dev** â†’ Staging / testing code
- **feature/*** â†’ New features or bug fixes

---

## Commit Message Rules
- Use **present tense** â†’ `"Add login page"`, not `"Added login page"`
- Keep commits **focused** on one change
- Avoid vague messages like `"update file"`

---

## Why Git in DevOps?

Git is essential in DevOps because it:
- Tracks changes to code
- Allows collaboration between team members
- Supports CI/CD workflows
- Enables rollback to previous stable versions
- Maintains project history
